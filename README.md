__Kind note:__

We expect you to __always__ come prepared to the class on Sunday.

## Module goals:

### Week 1-3:
A basic program with multiple functions (reacting to user input)

### Week 4-6:
A tool capable of loading a JSON file and representing it in the DOM

### Week 7-9:
A web app with external data source using at least one API 《〠_〠》

### Overall
A good understanding of all the above mentioned topics. Want to check your Knowledge? Go through the [JavaScript Fundamentals README](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/tree/master/fundamentals) and research/ ask for help (Slack!) with the concepts that are not entirely clear.
