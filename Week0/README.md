# Reading material for your first JavaScript lesson:

```
In week one we will discuss the following topics:
• The first part of the day Unmesh will talk about CLI (Command Line Interface)
• Intro JavaScript (What is it, where can you use it for)
• Variables [var, let, const]
• Basic Data types [Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans]
• Operators
```


## How to get started
1. Download and install the latest Current version of NodeJS - from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
To test that it was installed and running properly, go to your terminal and run the command: node -v You should get the node version printed on your terminal, for example, v8.8.0
