Exercise 2: Error debugging

Consider the following code:

console.log('I'm awesome'!;
Here are the requirements:

Copy the code in your .js file and run it in the command line using node.
You will see that you will get a SyntaxError.

Correct the mistake.
Hint: the SyntaxError message will give you some indication of what the error might be, but figure out yourself how to correct it!

Expected output: When done right, the command line should show the message I'm awesome!.
