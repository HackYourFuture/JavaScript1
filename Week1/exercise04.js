Exercise 4: Log the string

Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

Declare a variable myString and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.
Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
Now console.log the variable myString.
Now reassign to the variable myString a new string.
Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
Now console.log myString again.
