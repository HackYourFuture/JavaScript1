Exercise 8: Type checker

Create a function that fulfills the following requirements:

Takes in 2 arguments
Check the data type of each
Compares each data type
Logs to the console the message SAME TYPE if they are the same type. If they are different types log Not the same....
Follow the steps:

Declare 4 variables: 2 must be strings and 2 must be objects
Create 6 conditional statements, where for each you check if the data type of one variable is the same as the other
Find out how to check the type of a variable
Write 2 console.log statements to log the type of 2 variables, each with a different data type
Now compare the types of your different variables with one another
Log Not the same... when the types are different
Here's an incomplete example of how it could look:

// Declare all variables
let x = 9;
let y = 67;

// Check data type
console.log(...);

// Check if data type is the same
if (...) {
    console.log('SAME TYPE');
}
