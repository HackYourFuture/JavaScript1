//EXERCISE 9
//For each of these, write in comments what the answer is followed by how you came to that conclusion
//If x equals 7, and the only other 
//statement is x = x % 3, what would
//be the value of x after the calculation?

//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of 7 by 3, which gives us 1 as the remainder.
if(x = 7){
    x = x % 3;
    console.log(x);
}

//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of 21 by 4, which gives us 1 as the remainder.
if(y = 21){
    y = y % 4;
    console.log(x);
}

//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of 13 by 2, which gives us 1 as the remainder.
if(z = 13){
    z = z % 3;
    console.log(z);
