//1. If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the value of x after the calculation?
//x=1, because x should be the remainder of 7/3

let x =7;
console.log(x = x %3);


//2. if y equals 21, and the only other statement is y = y % 4, what would be the value of y after the calculation?
// y = 1, because y should be the remainder of 21/4

let y =21;
console.log(y = y %4);

//3. If z equals 13, and the only other statement is z = z % 2, what would be the value of z after the calculation?
// Again z =1, because z should be the remainder of 13/2

let z =13;
console.log(z = z %4);
