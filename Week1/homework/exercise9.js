let x = 7;

console.log (x=x%3)
// the equation above gives us x as 1, once the rest of 7 divided by 3 is 1 (2x3=6 and rests 1 to 7)
console.log (y=y%4)
// the equation above gives us y as 0, once the rest of 21 divided by 4 is 5.25 (4x5.25=21 and there is no rest)
console.log (z=z%2)
// the equation above gives us y as 1, once the rest of 13 divided by 2 is 1 (2x6=12 and rests 1 to 13)
