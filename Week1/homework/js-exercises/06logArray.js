// 1. Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. Make sure that the name of the variable indicates it contains more than 1 item. For example `items` instead of `item`.
const items = [];

console.log("The value of the array should be an empty array. '[]'");
// 3. Write a `console.log` statement that logs the array.
console.log(items);

const pets = ['Horse', "Pikachu", `Parrot`];
// 5. Write a `console.log` statement that logs the second array.
console.log(pets);
// 6. Add a statement that adds another string ("Piglet)" to the array of animals.
