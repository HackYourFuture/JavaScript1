//Exercise 5: Round a number and log it

//1-Declare a variable 'z' and assign the number 7.25 to it.
const z = 7.25;

//2-Write a 'console.log' statement in which you log the value of 'z'.
console.log(z);

//3-Declare another variable 'a' that has the value of 'z' but rounded to the nearest integer.
const a = 7;

//4-Write a 'console.log' statement in which you log the value of 'a'.
console.log(a);

//5-So now we have 'z' and 'a' find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.

const highest = a > z ? a : z;

//6-Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of the highest value.
console.log(highest);
