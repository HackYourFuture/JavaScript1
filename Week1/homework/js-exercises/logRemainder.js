//1. If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the value of x after the calculation?
let x = 7;
x = x % 3;
console.log(x);
// The answer is 1 because, "%" this operator is division remainder and after division of 7 to the 2, the remainder is 1.

//2. If y equals 21, and the only other statement is y = y % 4, what would be the value of y after the calculation?
let y = 21;
y = y % 4;
console.log(y);
// The answer is 1 because, "%" this operator is division remainder and after division of 21 to the 4, the remainder is 1.

//3. If z equals 13, and the only other statement is z = z % 2, what would be the value of z after the calculation?
let z = 13;
z = z % 2;
console.log(z);
// The answer is 1 because, "%" this operator is division remainder and after division of 13 to the 2, the remainder is 1.
