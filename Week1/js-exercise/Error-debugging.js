// if you want to use apostrophe in your string you have to put your string inside double quotes


/* For Example 
The most likely reason for use of single vs double in different libraries is programmer preference and/or API consistency.

Other than being consistent, use whichever best suits the string:.

Using the other type of quote as a literal:

alert('Say "Hello"');
alert("Say 'Hello'");
…but this can get complicated…

alert("It's \"game\" time.");
alert('It\'s "game" time.');
*/
/*
Another option, new in ES6

-alert(`Use "double" and 'single' quotes in the same string`);
alert(`Escape the \` back-tick character and the \${ dollar-brace sequence in a string`);
