/* In this situation, if we write:
console.log('I'm awesome');
it doesn't work and send us an error message.
In JavaScript, we can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote,
by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote. */
console.log("I'm awesome");
/* Now it works, because of our escaping character, backslash(\) */
//Or we can change the quotes:
console.log("I'm awesome");
