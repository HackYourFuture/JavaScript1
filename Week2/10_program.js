// 10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.

let myArray =["My age",30 , ["Student" ,5]]; // With array is possibale to store different data, within a single variable
console.log(myArray);


//10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
//10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program
let inf1 = 10/0;
let inf2 = 6/0;

function comparInfinities(inf1,inf2){
        if (inf2 = Number.MAX_VALUE , inf2 = Number.MAX_VALUE)
        console.log("inf1 and inf2 are infinity")
        else console.log("False")
