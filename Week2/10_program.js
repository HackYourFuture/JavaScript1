// 10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.

let myArray = ["My age", 30, ["Student", 5]]; // With array is possibale to store different data, within a single variable
console.log(myArray);


//10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
//10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program
let inf1 = 10 / 0;
let inf2 = 6 / 0;

if (inf2 === inf2)
        console.log("inf1 and inf2 are infinity")
else console.log("False")
