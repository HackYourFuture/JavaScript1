// 6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions).
// 6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
// 6.3 console.log your array.
// 6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
// 6.5 Log your array.
// 6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing array.
// 6.7 Log your new array!
