// TASK-6

/*
6. Arrays
6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you 
choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of 
containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions).
6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what 
you think the value of the array is.
6.3 console.log your array.
6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see 
if you can find a good name that exactly describes
what this variable will hold).
6.5 Log your array.
6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal 
('baby pig') to the existing array.
6.7 Log your new array!
