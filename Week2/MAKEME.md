## Homework Week 2

```
Topics discussed in class this week:
• Intro JavaScript (What is it, where can you use it for)
• Variables (var, let, const)
• Basic Data types (Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans)
• Operators
```

> [Here](/Week3/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the third lecture.

## Before you start with the homework:

1. Review the [Git course material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git) of last week.
2. Watch: [What is programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro), just watch the 2 min video, you do not have to do the entire JavaScript course (It could be useful later on though).
3. Please watch the following parts of the course, [Programming Foundations Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Welcome/83603/90426-4.html) on Lynda.com (if you don't have access to Lynda yet ask Gijs):
   <br>**0. Introduction**
   <br>**1. Programming Basics**
   <br>**2. Core Programming Syntax**
   <br>**3. Variables and Data Types**

## Step 2: JavaScript

_Deadline Thursday_

> For all the following exercises create a new `.js` file. Try to find a proper name for each file or make a small comment about what it does inside for future reference.

1\. Write a `console.log` statement saying "Hello World!" for each language that you know.

For example:

```
Halo, dunia! // Indonesian
Ciao, mondo! // Italian
Hola, mundo! // Spanish
```

2\. Consider the following code:

```js
console.log('I'm awesome');
```

Copy the code in your `.js` file and run it. You will see that you will get a SyntaxError. Find a solution for this error. Hint: read the error message carefully, it also gives an indication of where the problem is.

3\. Declare a variable `x` and initialize it with an integer, using these exact steps:  
3\.1 First, _declare_ your variable `x` (do not initialize it yet).  
3\.2 Add a `console.log` statement that explains in words what _you think_ the value of `x` is, like in this example:

```js
// TODO -> here you initialize your variable
console.log("the value of my variable x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog");
```

3\.3 Add a `console.log` statement that logs the value of `x`.  
3\.4 Now _initialize_ your variable `x` with an integer.  
3\.5 Next, add a `console.log` statement that explains what _you think_ the value of `x` is.  
3\.6 Add a `console.log` statement that logs the value of `x`.  
 Steps to be taken:

```js
// TODO -> here you declare your variable
console.log("the value of x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog");
// TODO -> log the actual value of x
// TODO -> here you initialize your variable
console.log("the value of x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog");
// TODO -> log value of x again
```

4\. Declare a variable `y` and assign a string to it.  
4\.1 Write a `console.log` statement in which you explain in words what _you think_ the value of the string is.  
4\.2 Now `console.log` the variable `y`.  
4\.3 Now assign a new string to the variable `y`.  
4\.4 Just like what you did before write a `console.log` statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.  
4\.5 Now console.log `y` again.

```js
// TODO -> here you declare AND assign your string
console.log("the value of my string will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog");
// TODO -> log the actual value of the string to the console
// TODO -> assign a new value to your variable x
console.log("the value of my string will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog");
// TODO -> log the actual value of the string to the console
```

5\. How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer (i.e., whole number)?  
5\.1 Declare a variable `z` and assign the number 7.25 to it.  
5\.2 `console.log` `z`.  
5\.3 Declare another variable `a` that has the value of `z` but rounded to the nearest integer.  
5\.4 `console.log` `a`.  
5\.5 So now we have `z` and `a` find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.  
5\.6 `console.log` the highest value.

6\. _Arrays_  
6\.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See [Naming conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)).  
6\.2 Write a `console.log` statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.  
6\.3 `console.log` your array.  
6\.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).  
6\.5 Log your array.  
6\.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the _existing array_.  
6\.7 Log your new array!

7\. _More strings_  
Let's consider the following string: `let myString = "this is a test"`.  
7\.1 Add the string to your file and console.log it.  
7\.2 Find a way to get the length of `myString`.  
7\.3 `console.log` the length of `myString`.

8\. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out `SAME TYPE` if they are the same type.  
8\.1 First declare at least four variables and assign them different data types.  
8\.2 For each variable write a `console.log` statement that logs the value

```js
let foo = 3;
console.log("The value of my variable foo is: " + foo);
```

(Curious to know what a `foo` is? Check [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) on Wikipedia.)

8\.3 Now write a `console.log` statement wherein you first explain in words what you think the _type_ of your variables is.  
8\.4 Now use `typeof` to log the actual _type_ of your variables.  
8\.5 Now compare the types of your different variables with one another.  
8\.6 Make sure to also show a message when the variables you are comparing are not the same type.

For example:

```js
let x = 9;
let y = 'Hello';

if (...) {
    console.log('SAME TYPE');
}
// TODO -> add a way of giving feedback if your variables don't have the same type
```

9\. If `x` equals 7, and the only other statement is `x = x % 3`, what would be the new value of `x`?  
9\.1 Add at least 3 `console.log` statements in which you show that you understand what `%` does.

10\. Write a program to answer the following questions:  
10\.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.  
10\.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?  
10\.3 Add `console.log` statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).

## Step 3: **Some freeCodeCamp challenges (10 hours):**

_Deadline Saturday_

On freeCodeCamp.com please do the [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/learn-how-free-code-camp-works) exercises up and until the **"Shopping List"** exercise (there are some topics we did not cover but you can do it).

## Step 4: Read before next lecture

_Deadline Sunday morning_

Go trough the reading material in the [README.md](/Week3/README.md) to prepare for your next class

### How to hand in Homework:

1. Fork the `HackYourFuture/JavaScript1` and bring it to your own GitHub `remote`.

2. Clone the repo which you forked in previous step and bring it to your `local` machine.

3. Create a branch say with the name `<yourname>-homework` i.e `yash-homework`

4. Create a JavaScript file named `<your-name>.js` i.e `yash.js`

5. Complete your homework in that JS file.

6. Push the changes to your remote repository from your local branch(remember `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`).

7. Create a pull request to submit your changes to the `master` branch of the original repo i.e `HackYourFuture/JavaScript1` repo.


Please feel free to drop a message if you have any confusions about the above steps.
```

### Hint

If you solve the FreeCodeCamp challenges and they are new concepts to you and you would like to take a look at them later on in the program, Copy your answers from FCC in a `.js` file and upload them to Github in a repository for future reference. In this way you build your own little documentation, if you look back at them first try to understand what it does before you run them.
