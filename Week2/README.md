# Reading material for the second lecture:

```
In week two we will discuss the following topics:
• Intro JavaScript (What is it, where can you use it for)
• Variables [var, let, const]
• Basic Data types [Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans]
• Operators
• Naming conventions
```

## How to get started
1. Download and install the *LTS* version of NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
To test that it was installed and running properly, go to your terminal and run the command: node -v You should get the node version printed on your terminal, for example, v8.9.1
2. Although you are free to make you own choice of text/code editor to use during class and homework, we have good experiences with Microsoft's free VSCode editor, which is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. Please refer to our [VSCode Tips](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/VSCodeTips/README.md) for more information.

## Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the coming lecture:
