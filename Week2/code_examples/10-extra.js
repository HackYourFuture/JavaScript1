//10. Write a program to answer the following questions:
//10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.
var items = ["planet", 9 , true]

//10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
//10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).
if (6/0 === 10/0) {console.log("same")
  } else {
    console.log("not same")
  }
