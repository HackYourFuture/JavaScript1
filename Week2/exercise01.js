Exercise 1: Remove the comma

Consider the following string:

let myString = 'hello,this,is,a,difficult,to,read,sentence';
Follow the steps:

Add the variable to your file.
Log the length of myString.
The commas make that the sentence is quite hard to read. Find a way to remove the commas from the string and replace them with spaces. (use Google!)
After replacing the commas, log myString to see if you succeeded.
Expected result in the console: hello this is a difficult to read sentence
