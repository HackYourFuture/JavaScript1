Exercise 3: The recipe card

Ever wondered how to make a certain meal? Let's create a recipe list with JavaScript!

Declare a variable that holds an empty object literal (your meal recipe).
Give the object 3 properties: a title (string), a servings (number) and an ingredients (array of strings) property.
Log each property out separately, using a loop (for, while or do/while)
Expected result:

Meal name: Omelette
Serves: 2
Ingredients: 4 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 1 tsp salt/pepper
