Exercise 4: The reading list

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

Follow the steps:

Declare a variable that holds an array of 3 objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (string), author (string), and alreadyRead (boolean indicating if you read it yet).
Loop through the array of books.
For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
Create a conditional statement to change the log depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like You already read "The Hobbit" right after the log of the book details
If you haven't read it log a string like You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings"
