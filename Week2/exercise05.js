Exercise 5: Who wants a drink?

You're at a party and you feel thirsty! However, you've got 5 friends who are also in need of a drink. Let's go get them a drink.

Declare a variable that holds an empty array, called drinkTray.
There are 3 different types of drinks:

const drinkTypes = ['cola', 'lemonade', 'water'];
Create a loop that runs 5 times. On each iteration, push a drink into the drinkTray variable. The drinkTray can only hold at most two instances of the same drink type, for example it can only hold 2 colas, 2 lemonades, 2 waters.
// Expected result:
const drinkTray = ['cola', 'cola', 'lemonade', 'lemonade', 'water'];

// 'Hey guys, I brought a cola, cola, lemonade, lemonade, water!'
If there are already two instances of a drinkType then start with the next drink in the array.
Your drinkTray should contain 2 cola, 2 lemonade and 1 water.
Log to the console: "Hey guys, I brought a [INSERT VALUES FROM ARRAY]!" (For example: "Hey guys, I brought a cola, cola, lemonade, lemonade, water!")
Test out your code using node in the command line!
