//5.1 Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.
const z= 7.25;



//5.2 console.log z.
console.log(z);



//5.3 Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.
const a=  Math.round(z);



//5.4 console.log a.
console.log(a);




//5.5 So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.
let max = Math.max(a, z);





//5.6 console.log the highest value.
console.log(max);
