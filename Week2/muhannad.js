console.log("I'm awesome");

//1 First, declare your variable x (do not initialize it yet).
let x;
//3.2 Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is, like in this example:
console.log(`the value of my variable x will be undefined because it dose not have any value yet`);
//3.3 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of x.
console.log(x);
//3.4 Now initialize your variable x with an integer.
x = 11;
//3.5 Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of x is.
console.log('the value of x will be 11');
//3.6 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of x.
console.log(x);
//4. Declare a variable y and assign a string to it.
let y = 'hello javascript';
//4.1 Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
console.log('the value of x will be: hello javascript');
//4.2 Now console.log the variable y.
console.log(y);
//4.3 Now assign a new string to the variable y.
y = 'i am studying javascript';
//4.4 Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
console.log('the value of x will be: i am studying javascript');
//Now console.log y again.
console.log(y);
//How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer (i.e., whole number)?
//5.1 Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.
const z = 7.25;
//5.2 console.log z.
console.log(z);
//5.3 Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.
let a = z;
//5.4 console.log a.
console.log(Math.round(a));
//5.5 So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.
//i think there are many way's to compare between 2 'built-in functions' or more value's. this is in a different way one of them.
//5.6 console.log the highest value.
if (a > z) {
  const newValue = a;
  console.log('bigger than b', newValue);
} else {
  const newValue = z;
  console.log('z is bigger than a', newValue);
}
const maxValue = Math.max(a, z);
console.log(maxValue);
///////////Arrays/////////////
//6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions).
let arr1 = [];
//6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
console.log('the value of arr1 will be undefined or empty');
//6.3 console.log your array.
console.log(arr1);
//6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
let favoriteAnimals = ['rabbit', 'cow', 'dog', 'cat'];
//6.5 Log your array.
console.log(favoriteAnimals);
//6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing array.
favoriteAnimals.push('baby pig');
//6.7 Log your new array!
console.log(favoriteAnimals);
//7. More strings
//Let's consider the following string: let myString = "this is a test".
//7.1 Add the string to your file and console.log it.
let myString = 'this is a test';
console.log(myString);
//7.2 Find a way to get the length of myString.
//7.3 console.log the length of myString.
console.log(myString.length);
///////////////////////
//8. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type.
//8.1 First declare at least four variables and assign them different data types.
let v1 = 'text1';
let v2 = 'text2';
let v3 = 25;
let v4 = false;
//8.2 For each variable write a console.log statement that logs the value
console.log(v1, v2, v3, v4);
//8.3 Now write a console.log statement wherein you first explain in words what you think the type of your variables is.
console.log('v1:string , v2:string , v3:number , v4:boolean');
//8.4 Now use typeof to log the actual type of your variables.
let checkV1 = typeof v1;
let checkV2 = typeof v2;
let checkV3 = typeof v3;
let checkV4 = typeof v4;
console.log(checkV1, checkV2, checkV3, checkV4);
//8.5 Now compare the types of your different variables with one another.
if (checkV1 === checkV2) {
  console.log('SAME THE TYPE');
} else {
  console.log('NOT THE SAME TYPE');
}
//8.6 Make sure to also show a message when the variables you are comparing are not the same type.
if (checkV3 === checkV4) {
  console.log('SAME THE TYPE');
} else {
  console.log('NOT THE SAME TYPE');
}
//9. If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?
//9.1 Add at least 3 console.log statements in which you show that you understand what % does.
let result = x % 3;
console.log(result);
console.log(34 % 10); //    ==>   it give 4
console.log(5 % 2); //    ==>   it give 1
console.log(15 % 4); //    ==>   it give 3
//10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.
var information = [
  'javascript',
  15,
  true,
  (arr2 = ['firstIndex', 'secondIndex', 'thirdIndex']),
  x,
  'jquery',
];
//show latest Array:information
for (let i = 0; i < information.length; i++) {
  console.log(information[i]);
}
//10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
function divideByZero(num1) {
  return num1 / 0;
}

//10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).
console.log(divideByZero(145));
