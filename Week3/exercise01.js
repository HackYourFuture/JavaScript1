Exercise 1: You are amazing, Noer!

There is no better way to start your day then with a compliment!

Write a function named giveCompliment
It takes 1 argument: your name
Inside the function define a variable that holds an array, compliments, with 10 strings. Each string should be a compliment, like "great", "awesome"
Write code that randomly selects a compliment
Return a string: "You are [COMPLIMENT], [YOUR_NAME]!
Call the function three times, giving each function call the same argument: your name.
// Expected output
giveCompliment('Noer'); // Returns "You are amazing, Noer!"
giveCompliment('Noer'); // Returns "You are great, Noer!"
giveCompliment('Noer'); // Returns "You are supersmart, Noer!"
