Exercise 2: Dog years

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Let's calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge.
It takes 1 argument: your (fictional) puppy's age (number).
Calculate your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
Return a string: "Your doggie is [CALCULATED_VALUE] years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
// Expected output
calculateDogAge(1); // Returns "Your doggie is 7 years old in dog years!"
calculateDogAge(2); // Returns "Your doggie is 14 years old in dog years!"
calculateDogAge(3); // Returns "Your doggie is 21 years old in dog years!"
