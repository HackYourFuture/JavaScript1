Exercise 3: Be your own fortune teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Create 4 arrays, numChildren, partnerNames, locations and jobs. Give each array 5 random string values that have to do with the name of the variable
Write a function named tellFortune.
It takes 4 arguments: number of children (number), partner's name (string), geographic location (string), job title (string).
Randomly select values from the arrays.
Return a string: "You will be a [JOB_TITLE] in [LOCATION], married to [PARTNER_NAME] with [NUMBER_KIDS] kids."
Call the function 3 times, by passing the arrays as the argument.
// Expected output
const numChildren = [...];
const partnerNames = [...];
const locations = [...];
const jobs = [...];

tellFortune(numChildren, partnerNames, locations, jobs); // Returns "You will be a programmer in The Netherlands, married to Layla with 3 kids."
tellFortune(numChildren, partnerNames, locations, jobs); // Returns "You will be a farmer in France, married to Muhammed with 2 kids."
tellFortune(numChildren, partnerNames, locations, jobs); // Returns "You will be a teacher in The United States, married to Zara with 4 k
