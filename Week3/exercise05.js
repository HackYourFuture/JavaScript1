Exercise 5: Total cost is ...

You want to buy a couple of things from the supermarket to prepare for a party. After scanning all the items the cashier wants to give you the total price, but the machine is broken! Let's write her a function that does it for her instead!

Create an object named cartForParty with 5 properties. Each property should be a grocery item (like beers or chips) and hold a number value (like 1.75 or 0.99)
Write a function called calculateTotalPrice
It takes 1 argument: an object that contains properties that only contain number values
Loop through the object and add all the number values together
Return a string: "Total: €[TOTAL_PRICE_ITEMS]"
Call the function 1 time, giving it the object cartForParty as an argument
const cartForParty = { ... }

// Expected output
calculateTotalPrice(cartForParty); // Returns "Total: €10.75"
