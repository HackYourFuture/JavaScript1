//  17. What does the following code return? (And why?)

// let bar = 42;
// typeof typeof bar;

// > â€˜Coerce' means to try to change - so coercing `var x = '6'` to number means trying to change the type to number temporarily.

//  it's gonna return string since 'typeof bar' is a number and 'typeof number' is a string!
