/*
if (3 === 3) {
  console.log("yes");
} else {
  console.log("no");
}

in the example above, (3 === 3) is always true
 thats why console logs "yes" surely.
if there is sth that i need to see or understand, unfortunately i did not. >> **last rows added**
i am looking for feedback...
*/

console.log("yes");

// ** last rows

console.log ( (3 == 3) ? 'yes' : 'no');

// :))) i just now understand challange. is ti true?
