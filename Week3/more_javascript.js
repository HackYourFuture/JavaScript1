// Explanation: 
//      - Arrays are compared by their reference.

// Explanation:
//Both o2 and o3 are pointing to the same object which means that change o2 will defently lead to change o3
//In the other hand o1 is another object and point to another location in the memory so the modifation of o1 doesn't  effect  o3

/* - Does the order that you assign (o3 = o2 or o2 = o3) matter?*/
// Explanation:
//- const o3 = o2;
//      -> This statement is pointing 03 to o2 which is already declared and initialized.
//-  const 02 = 03; 
//      -> Means that we redelared a variable which is return SyntaxError
//-  o2 = o3 
//      -> Means that o2 is pointing to not declared object(03) which result in ReferenceError: s3 is not defined
